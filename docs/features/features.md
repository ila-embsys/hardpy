# Features

## Based on pytest

**HardPy** includes the pytest-hardpy plugin for **pytest**.
Compatible with pytest versions above 7.
You can run tests not only through the operator panel but also through the **pytest** itself.

## Document-oriented NoSQL database

**HardPy** uses [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) as its database but you can write
final result to any database because **CouchDB** stores data in a simple document.
Developers can create their adapter for any database and store the test report in a way that suits them.
By default **HardPy** allows you to store all reports in **CouchDB**.
**HardPy** is compatible with **CouchDB** versions above 3.2.

## Tests view in browser

**HardPy** includes a **React** application - **HardPy operator panel**.
It allows you to use a browser to view your tests and write test results to a database.

## Modern python

**HardPy** is based on the **python 3.10** and supports versions **3.11**, **3.12**.
